VectorProcessingTPCH
====================
The project needs Boost library as well as the C++ Vector library from www.agner.org/optimize.

Goal of this work is to educate myself on writing highly optimized code and gain expertise with AVX.

QT is used as the IDE since it has clang.
Platform codegen flags : -march=core-avx2 -fabi-version=0 -v
